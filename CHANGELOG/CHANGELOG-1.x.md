## [1.7.0] - 2025-09-01

### Added
### Changed
- **debt:** Upgraded all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
- **risk:** Updated copyright to reflect date range through present year.
- **risk:** Removed `t.Parallel()` from fuzz tests as fuzzing already runs inputs in parallel. 
  - The fuzz engine schedules many inputs concurrently across workers (bounded by CPUs / `-test.parallel`). Adding `t.Parallel()` makes each input’s subtest itself run in parallel with others—an unnecessary second layer of parallelism.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
### Changed
- **debt:** Updated to Go `1.25` to leverage the latest language features and performance improvements.

### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- **defect:** Go `1.25.0`: The `AllocsPerRun` function now panics if parallel tests are running. The result of `AllocsPerRun` is inherently flaky if other tests are running. The new panicking behavior helps catch such bugs.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-07-23

### Added
### Changed
- **risk:** Implemented automatic fork detection and random stream reseeding using process PID tracking. After a process fork, DRBG instances will securely reseed to prevent duplicate random streams in parent and child processes. This eliminates a longstanding CSPRNG risk in forked environments and aligns user-space DRBG safety with that of kernel-backed generators. See `ForkDetectionInterval` in [configuration](../config.go) for tuning and compliance.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
### Changed
- **feature:** Prediction resistance mode (`WithPredictionResistance`), enabling NIST SP 800-90A Section 9.3 compliance by reseeding before every output.
- **feature:** Automatic interval-based reseeding (`WithReseedInterval`) and reseed-on-request-count (`WithReseedRequests`) options.
- **feature:** Added `ReadWithAdditionalInput([]byte)` method for supplying per-call additional input as permitted by the NIST SP 800-90A standard.
- **feature:** Added `Reseed([]byte)` method to manually reseed a DRBG instance with new entropy.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-19

### Added
### Changed
- **debt**: Removed unnecessary heap and stack allocations in DRBG fast path
  - Moved all `[16]byte` temporary block buffers to pre-allocated struct fields to eliminate stack allocations and heap escapes.
  - Ensured all block encryption scratch space is reused via DRBG instance buffers rather than stack or ephemeral variables.
